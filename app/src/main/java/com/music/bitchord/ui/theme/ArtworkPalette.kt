/**
 * The colours an album, playlist or artist page paints itself in.
 *
 * Apple Music's release pages are not one design tinted five ways — the whole
 * page is derived from the sleeve, down to which grey the metadata line is. So
 * rather than hand callers a raw swatch and let each of them guess, this is the
 * finished set: a page tint, an accent that is legible *on that tint*, and the
 * two text colours and hairline that go with them.
 *
 * Every value is theme-aware. The same sleeve yields a near-black tint in dark
 * mode and a pale wash of the same hue in light mode, which is the only way the
 * pages stay readable when the app's theme disagrees with the artwork's.
